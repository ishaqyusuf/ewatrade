# API Contracts

## General

- All tenant-owned reads/writes resolve tenant context server-side.
- On the shared dashboard host, the active-tenant cookie is propagated through
  both server and browser tRPC clients. An explicit tenant header still has
  priority where supported.
- Store ids are validated against the active tenant.
- Exact quantities/factors are decimal strings; money is integer minor units.
- Commands use stable client ids and payload hashes for idempotency.
- Immutable snapshots preserve historical meaning; clients never reconstruct
  inventory or Order truth from current mutable Catalog data.

## Catalog

- Item kind is immutable after creation.
- Variant option combinations are separate from Offerings and units.
- Product Unit Offerings require fixed prices and a Current Inventory Unit.
- Service Offerings may be fixed or quote-required and never accept stock
  input.
- Unit Draft publication validates one factor-1 Canonical Unit, direct exact
  factors, precision, Offering replacement and any required Stock Transition.

## Inventory

- Every operation identifies an explicit Balance Source and expected revision.
- Shared/Packaged stock is never substituted automatically.
- Transformations require balanced compatible Packaged Stock endpoints.
- Corrections append reversal/replacement facts; posted operations are not
  edited in place.
- Reports serialize exact quantities and configuration context.

## Orders

- A line selects one active Store-available Offering and snapshots its price,
  quantity and semantic context at confirmation.
- Product reservation/fulfillment and Service work creation are separate
  transactional effects.
- Mixed Product/Service Orders are supported.

## Services

- Service Request is unconfirmed intent and creates no Order/work.
- Quote Versions are immutable; only the current unexpired version may be
  accepted. Acceptance is idempotent.
- Direct Intake confirmation and Quote acceptance create the Commercial
  Order/tracked work graph atomically.
- Job Line revision guards stale work transitions, authorization, split,
  assignment and promise changes.
- Evidence is private by default. Client contracts can report local, queued,
  uploading or failed state but cannot mark an asset safe/available. Trusted
  infrastructure must supply safe asset and safety metadata before manager
  publication can succeed.
- A mobile capture stored as `LOCAL` references a file retained in that app
  installation's documents directory. It is not a cloud URL, is never returned
  publicly, and cannot be published.
- Public tracking is an allowlisted projection and never returns internal notes,
  actors, private evidence, raw storage references or private contacts.
- Public tracking includes the tenant timezone so customer promise dates are
  formatted consistently and accurately.

## Offline

- Supported command payloads are versioned and dependency-aware.
- Offline Intake evidence depends on the Intake command and carries its stable
  client id so replay resolves the newly created tenant-owned Job; a missing or
  charge-only Job fails as a typed evidence conflict.
- Replay returns applied, review-required, blocked or discarded outcomes with
  typed conflict codes and authoritative state.
- Unsupported old event shapes are discarded; there is no compatibility
  reader.
- Public Requests/Quotes, payment, evidence publication and provider delivery
  are online-only.
